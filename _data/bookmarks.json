    "description": "Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what. This makes cryptography an inherently \\textit{political} tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically \\textit{moral} dimension. The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral positioning of cryptography. They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our field. I believe that it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to resist mass surveillance. I plea for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal implications of our work.",
