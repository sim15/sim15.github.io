permalink: /projects/anoncom
---

Paired with the rise of consumer data analytics, the continued transition of interpersonal communication onto the Internet has made privacy an increasingly important requirement in many network systems. Although attempts by services such as WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook Messenger to employ methods of end-to-end encryption have succeeded in securing message content, leaked metadata has exposed the power of underlying communication data. In this work, we present a set of lightweight constructions for anonymous communication with cryptographic privacy guarantees for users.
