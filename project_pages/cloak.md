Many online resources are pay-walled or otherwise restricted to the public. To access these resources, users need to prove access privileges through an authentication mechanism. For example, news websites such as the New York Times (NYT) offer news articles exclusively to paid subscribers. To access NYT articles, users provide the NYT website with an email and password associated with an active subscription (users to the NYT). What if users want to preserve their privacy and not reveal which articles they consume? An anonymous authentication mechanism can solve this problem. We introduce a novel zero-knowledge proof protocol towards the development of a framework for anonymous authentication.
